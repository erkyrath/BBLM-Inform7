BBEdit/TextWrangler Language Module for Inform 7
  https://github.com/erkyrath/BBLM-Inform7
Created by Andrew Plotkin

This is a simple syntax coloring module for Inform 7. It is not as
complete as the syntax-coloring in the I7 IDEs. This module currently
handles comments (including nested comments), strings, string
substitutions, section headers, and I6 inclusions. Sections will
be listed in the editor's "Functions" menu, and are also foldable.

If you're reading this file because you want to install the module,
you've got the wrong download! This is the source code. The compiled,
installable module is at:

The "BBI7.cp" source file is in the public domain.

The header files in "SDK Headers" are taken from the BBEdit Development Kit,
and are copyright Bare Bones Software, Inc.
