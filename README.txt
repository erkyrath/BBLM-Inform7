BBEdit/TextWrangler Language Module for Inform 7
Created by Andrew Plotkin

This is a simple syntax coloring module for Inform 7. It is not as
complete as the syntax-coloring in the I7 IDEs. This module currently
handles comments (including nested comments), strings, string
substitutions, and I6 inclusions.

The "BBI7.cp" source file is in the public domain.

The header files in "SDK Headers" are taken from the BBEdit Development Kit,
